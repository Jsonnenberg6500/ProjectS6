        <h2>Week 1</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Created project schedule</li>
                <li>Started Phase 1 test plan</li>
                <li>Tested bus and PCAN adapters using PCAN-view as a group.  All nodes on the bus are operational</li>
                <li>Started writing code for closed loop feedback testing as a group</li>
            </ul>

	<h2>Week 2</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li>Inherited CAN protocol designed by Tommy and his group</li>
            <li>Completed detailed testing plan document for all Phase one validation requirements.  Test is broken into two main sections:
                <ol>
                    <li>Call station and Elevator Car Testing
                        <ul>
                            <li>Testing up/down switches and lights of each call station</li>
                            <li>Testing open/close switches and lights of the elevator car</li>
                            <li>Testing the floor slection switches and lights of the elevator car</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>System Level Testing
                        <ul>
                            <li>Testing elevator system to ensure it covers at least three floors, with one CAN node per floor</li>
                            <li>Testing the system capability to detect the location of the elevator car (with the distance sensor) and its ability to distribute this information to all call-stations for displaying on the appropriate displays</li>
                            <li>Ensuring the system an detect up/down requests at any floor and switch on the respective LED</li>
                            <li>Ensuring the system can detect floor selection at any floor and switch on the respective LED</li>
                            <li>Ensuring the system can detect a door open/close request at any floor and switch on the repective LED</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>           
            </li>
            <li>Helped Ovi and James debug code for sending/receiving via CAN bus between two Axmans</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Got filtering working (multiple filters can now be set for each node)
            <ul>
                <li>Issue was with that we used code from the AN3034 appnote for sending and code from Bill (Stefanuk) for receiving.  It turns out that we were applying filters in the CANinit() function from the appnote and <b><i>again</i></b> in Bill's MSCANlisten().  The second time we applied the filter we overwrote the previous filters that were applied. </li>
                <li>After solving this issue we are able to apply multiple filters and have confirmed that sending </li></ul></li>
            <li>Started setting up seperate projects for each node type with the appropriate filters.  Want to have a header file common to all nodes that defines interconnection of the system (filters, etc)</li>
        </ul>
