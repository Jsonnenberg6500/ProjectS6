		<h2>Week 1</h2>

		<u1>
			<li>Started CAN Elevator Project</li>
			<li>Phase 1 (4 Weeks) Can Network and Protocol </li>
			<li>Phase 2 (7 Weeks) LAN conneting to Elevator Controller </li>
			<li>Phase 3 (3 Weeks) Integration
			<p></p>
			<li>Project Group: Kevin, James, Ovi </li>
			<p></p>
			<li>Tested the BUS line using PCAN View. </li>
			<li>Installed PCAN drivers on computer. </li>
			<p></p>
			<li>Started looking at the AN3034 App Note, and started programming Axeman </li>
			<li>Found errors, ex: CAN0CTL1 should be CANCTL1 </li>

		</ul>


		<h2>Week 2</h2>

		<ul>

			<li>Continued working on the sending code</li>
			<li>Ran into some problems, we were working in simulation mode, and kept getting
			errors that MSCAN was not configured</li>
			<li>The bit speed was incorrect on the HCS12 and the pcan view computer</li>
			<li>Completed new speed calculations for 125Kb as agreed upon by the class, time quanta N = 8 </li>
			<p></p>
			<li>Having issues with receivng on the axman while sending from pcan</li>
			<li>We are unable to trigger the flag that says we have received a message</li>
			<p></p>
			<li>Receiving works now, we were just queuing up messages instead of actually sending them in PCANview</li>

		</ul>

		<h2>Week 3</h2>

		<ul>

			<li>Send and Receive works between two Axman</li>
			<li>Configured a push button to send a CAN message to turn on an LED on another Axman</li>
			<li>Used DDRA = 0xFF, to configure all 8 bits of port A to be outout</li>
			<li>PORTA was used to read the actual port values</li>
			<p></p>
			<li>Setup multiple filters for different ID messages</li>
			<li>Had a problem where we were initializing the number of filters in two locations causing problems</li>
			<li>The acceptance code ID for message 100 is 0x2000, and for ID 200 the code is 0x4000</li>
			<li>Tested the filters, we now have nodes that can accept multiple message ID's</li>

		</ul>
